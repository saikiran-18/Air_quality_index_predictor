# Air Quality Index Predictor

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various air pollutant concentrations and weather conditions.
 It includes two distinct models built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): a **regression model** to predict the precise numerical AQI value
and a **classification model** to predict the corresponding AQI category (e.g., "Good", "Unhealthy").

The project utilizes the `global_air_quality_dataset` from Kaggle, which contains a rich set of features including:

-   **Pollutants**: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3
-   **Weather Data**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed

The solution is structured into several key phases:

1.  **Data Loading & Inspection**: Loading the dataset and performing an initial check for shape, columns, and missing values.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, calculating the target AQI values based on US EPA guidelines, and scaling the features for optimal model performance.
3.  **Model Building**: Developing two separate ANN modelsâ€”one for regression and one for classification.
4.  **Training**: Compiling and training the models using an efficient optimizer and callbacks to prevent overfitting.
5.  **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with appropriate metrics for both regression (MAE, RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix).
6.  **Inference**: Providing a snippet for making real-time predictions on a single new data point.

### Key Outputs to Look For

  - **Model Summaries**: Details on the layers and parameters of both the regression and classification ANNs.
  - **Training Plots**: Visualizations of training and validation loss/accuracy to show how the models learned over epochs.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**:
      - **Regression**: MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$ scores, which quantify the model's predictive accuracy for numerical AQI.
      - **Classification**: Accuracy, a detailed classification report, and a confusion matrix to show the model's performance in predicting AQI categories.
  - **Real-time Prediction**: A simple function and example usage to predict the AQI for a new set of pollutant and weather readings.
